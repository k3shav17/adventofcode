/**
 * --- Day 2: Corruption Checksum ---
 * <p>
 * As you walk through the door, a glowing humanoid shape yells in your direction. "You there! Your
 * state appears to be idle. Come help us repair the corruption in this spreadsheet - if we take
 * another millisecond, we'll have to display an hourglass cursor!"
 * <p>
 * The spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers. To make sure the recovery process
 * is on the right track, they need you to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row,
 * determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the
 * sum of all of these differences.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the following spreadsheet:
 * <p>
 * 5 1 9 5 7 5 3 2 4 6 8
 * <p>
 * The first row's largest and smallest values are 9 and 1, and their difference is 8. The second
 * row's largest and smallest values are 7 and 3, and their difference is 4. The third row's
 * difference is 6.
 * <p>
 * In this example, the spreadsheet's checksum would be 8 + 4 + 6 = 18.
 * <p>
 * What is the checksum for the spreadsheet in your puzzle input?
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * --- Part Two ---
 * <p>
 * "Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all. Here's a star for your effort."
 * However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs be worried?
 * <p>
 * "Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the
 * evenly divisible values in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind
 * of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations."
 * <p>
 * It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the
 * other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like
 * you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the following spreadsheet:
 * <p>
 * 5 9 2 8 9 4 7 3 3 8 6 5
 * <p>
 * In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are 8 and 2; the result of this
 * division is 4. In the second row, the two numbers are 9 and 3; the result is 3. In the third row,
 * the result is 2.
 * <p>
 * In this example, the sum of the results would be 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.
 * <p>
 * What is the sum of each row's result in your puzzle input?
