/**
 * Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but
 * by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss a hin The sto ns split
 * into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of
 * <p>
 * location IDs. There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side y side (your puzzle
 * <p>
 * input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The
 * Historians reconcile their lists?
 *
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <p>
 * 3 4 4 3 2 5 1 3 3 9 3 3
 * <p>
 * Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the
 * <p>
 * numbers and measure how
 * <p>
 * far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the
 * <p>
 * smallest number in the
 * <p>
 * right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest
 * <p>
 * right number, and so
 * <p>
 * on.
 * <p>
 * Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need
 * <p>
 * to add up all of
 * <p>
 * those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list,
 * the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is
 * <p>
 * 6.
 * <p>
 * In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * right list is 3. The
 * <p>
 * and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
 * The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0. The next numbers
 * to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1. The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a
 * distance of 2. Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the
 * right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.
 * <p>
 * To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between
 * all the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of
 * 11!
 * <p>
 * Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between
 * your lists?
