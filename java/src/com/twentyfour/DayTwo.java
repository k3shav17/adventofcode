/**
 * Fortunately, the first location The Historians want to search isn't a long walk from the Chief
 * Historian's office.
 * <p>
 * While the Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant appears to contain no sign of the Chief
 * Historian, the engineers there run up to you as soon as they see you. Apparently, they still talk
 * about the time Rudolph was saved through molecular synthesis from a single electron.
 * <p>
 * They're quick to add that - since you're already here - they'd really appreciate your help
 * analyzing some unusual data from the Red-Nosed reactor. You turn to check if The Historians are
 * waiting for you, but they seem to have already divided into groups that are currently searching
 * every corner of the facility. You offer to help with the unusual data.
 * <p>
 * The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many reports, one report per line. Each report
 * is a list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces. For example:
 * <p>
 * 7 6 4 2 1 1 2 7 8 9 9 7 6 2 1 1 3 2 4 5 8 6 4 4 1 1 3 6 7 9
 * <p>
 * This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.
 * <p>
 * The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety
 * systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing.
 * So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:
 * <p>
 * The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing. Any two adjacent levels differ by at
 * least one and at most three.
 * <p>
 * In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:
 * <p>
 * 7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2. 1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is
 * an increase of 5. 9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4. 1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3
 * is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing. 8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a
 * decrease. 1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.
 * <p>
 * So, in this example, 2 reports are safe.
 * <p>
 * Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. How many reports are safe?
