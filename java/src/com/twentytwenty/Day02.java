/**
 * Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast
 * from here is via toboggan.
 * <p>
 * The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong
 * with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if you can take a look.
 * <p>
 * Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been
 * allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.
 * <p>
 * To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according
 * to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose you have the following list:
 * <p>
 * 1-3 a: abcde 1-3 b: cdefg 2-9 c: ccccccccc
 * <p>
 * Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the
 * lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For
 * example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
 * <p>
 * In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no
 * instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a
 * or nine c, both within the limits of their respective policies.
 * <p>
 * How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
