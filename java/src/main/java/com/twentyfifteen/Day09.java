/**
 * --- Day 9: All in a Single Night ---
 * <p>
 * Every year, Santa manages to deliver all of his presents in a single night.
 * <p>
 * This year, however, he has some new locations to visit; his elves have provided him the distances
 * between every pair of locations. He can start and end at any two (different) locations he wants,
 * but he must visit each location exactly once. What is the shortest distance he can travel to
 * achieve this?
 * <p>
 * For example, given the following distances:
 * <p>
 * London to Dublin = 464
 * London to Belfast = 518
 * Dublin to Belfast = 141
 * <p>
 * The possible routes are therefore:
 * <p>
 * Dublin -> London -> Belfast = 982
 * London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605
 * London -> Belfast -> Dublin = 659
 * Dublin -> Belfast -> London = 659
 * Belfast -> Dublin -> London = 605
 * Belfast -> London -> Dublin = 982
 * <p>
 * The shortest of these is London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605, and so the answer is 605 in this
 * example.
 * <p>
 * What is the distance of the shortest route?
