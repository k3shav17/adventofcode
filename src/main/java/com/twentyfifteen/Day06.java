/**
 * --- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---
 * <p>
 * Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after
 * year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on
 * how to display the ideal lighting configuration.
 * <p>
 * Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are
 * at 0,0, 0,999, 999,999, and 999,0. The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or
 * toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair represents
 * opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore
 * refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.
 * <p>
 * To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the
 * instructions Santa sent you in order.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light. toggle 0,0 through 999,0
 * would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the
 * ones that were off. turn off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle
 * four lights.
 * <p>
 * After following the instructions, how many lights are lit? turn off 660,55 through 986,197 toggle
 * 322,558 through 977,958 turn on 240,129 through 703,297
